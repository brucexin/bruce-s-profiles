<title>Python-mode Extensions</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2>Python EMACS Extensions</h2>
<p>This package contains three extensions to python-mode which I find useful when programming python. They are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>py-mode-ext.el which allows more convient execution of python
  code from within emacs than can be done using python-mode. 
  Also included are funtions which facilitate moving around an error
  traceback. </li>
  <li>pyp.el which facilitates the insertion of degugging print requests.</li>
  <li>enhancements to pycomplete (pycomplete.el and pycomplete.py)
  which shows  all possible completions within a separate buffer and
  shows  which are methods as opposed to attributes. </li>
</ul>
<p>They are packaged separately so that one may choose which to use.
I have used the first two for some time and find that they are very
useful. The pycomplete enhancement also seems useful but I have not
been using it long.</p>

<p>I have successfully used these extensions on both Emacs-21 and
Emacs-22. 

<h3>py-mode-ext</h3>

<p>I really like to run and debugging python programs from inside of
emacs but I have wanted to see a couple of additional features added
to python-mode.el This applies to executing the program as well as
running with a symbolic debugger.

</p><ul>

<li>I want to be able to conveniently supply arguments to the
program under test.
<br>
<br>
</li><li>
There are times when I forget to save the buffers that I am
editing, so I would like to have emacs inquire if I want them saved
and respond to my reply.

<br>
<br>
</li><li> Frequently, my programs involve more than one module and
here python-mode foils me because it saves the current buffer as a
temporary file in a temporary directory with a manufactured, unique
name. There is no way that another module of the program will be
found. I therefore want any changed modules saved and executed from
the directory where they are normally stored. Perhaps the 'main' module is not
the one I just edited so I want to be able to specify the module
to be entered.

<br>
<br>
</li><li>
I would like to have history capability to remember initial
modules and argument lists used in the Emacs session.
<br>
<br>

</li><li>Since python-mode allows me to execute a program with a simple key
sequence, I then want to execute the program with the python debugger
as easily.
<br>
<br>

</li><li>I am a fan of PyChecker, so I want to be able to easily run that
program from Emacs and be able to jump to source lines corresponding
to PyChecker messages.

</li></ul> py-mode-ext.el is a short bit of emacs lisp which I assert
accomplishes the above.  I am new to writing elisp so I welcome
comments and suggestions.


<p>To use these extensions, py-mode-ext.el is placed in my emacs load
path. See below for the code that I inserted into my .emacs file.



<p>When the user invokes py-execute-prog or py-call-pdb, the
following sequence occurs.

</p><ol>
<li>
 It first reads from the mini-buffer the name of the initial file to be 
 executed by the interpreter. If no history exists, then the file behind 
 the current buffer is suggested.   The user may then substitute any file 
 he wishes as the initial file to be executed by the interpreter. It will 
 be save in a history list. 


<br>
<br>
</li><li> Next, it reads from the mini-buffer the argument string to
 be passed to the program being interpreted.  Again, if there is a
 history of arguments, the most recent will be selected.  The user may
 over ride the suggestion.  The argument string passed to the program
 will be saved in a history list.


<br>
<br>
</li><li>
 It next saves all the modified buffers based on queries.   


<br>
<br>
</li><li>
 Finally, it invokes python on the initial file or it invokes pdb on 
 the initial file.
</li></ol>

<h4>Traceback Navigation</h4>
<p>py-mode-ext.el also includes several functions for moving up and
down the trace back stack when a error occurs.  The following commands
are implemented.


<ul>

<li> py-last-exception which will take you to the source line referred
                             to in the inner most level of the
                             traceback.  That is, the bottom or often
                             most interesting line

<li>py-next-exception which will take you to the source line referred
                             to in next level of the trace back.

<li>py-last-exception which will take you to the source line referred
                             to in the previous level of the trace back.

<li> py-current-line-exception which will take you to the source line
                             referred to in the selected line of the
                             trace back, i.e., select the line you
                             want to go to in the *Python Output*
                             window and invoke this function.



</ul>


<p>
 You may invoke these functions with the following key sequences:
<ul>
<li>
       "\C-x\C-l" 'py-last-exception
<li>       "\C-x\C-p" 'py-previous-exception
<li>       "\C-x\C-n" 'py-next-exception
<li>       "\C-x\C-e" 'py-current-line-exception
</ul>

 Start with \C-x\C-l. Then move up or down the stack.

<p>
 The easist way to navigation an error trace when executing a program
 is to use mouse-3.  [mouse-3] is defined to invoke
 'py-current-line-exception.  Just go to the *Python Output* window,
 select the traceback line you want to visit with mouse-1 and push the
 mouse-3 button. This is the variation that I use most often.

<p>
Since I have been using the traceback navigation above and pyp to
easily insert debugging statements, I have not used the debugger very
often. 

<h4>Invoking Pychecker</h4>
</p><p>When the user initiates the command for pychecker, it will check
whether any buffers have been changed and ask whether you want any of
those saved. Then it will run PyChecker against the file behind the
current buffer.

<h3>pyp</h3>


<p>pyp is a pair of functions which facilitate adding print
statements to a python module. They are:
<ul>
<li>pyp (standing for python print).  This function asks the user in the
minibuffer for the expression to be printed.  An expression is then
typed in and the return key is pressed.  The result is a print
statement printing the expression as a string followed by the value of
the expression, followed a by comment containing  by your userid  and
pyp. In addition, the resulting output contains the name of the
enclosing function and class included for easier identification of the
output information.  The resulting statment looks like:<br><br>
print "containing_class: containing_function: expression =",
expression  # user_name pyp
<br>
<br>
<li>ppy (standing for pretty print python).  This also solicits an
expression puts out a print statement giving the expression as well as
a statement which pretty prints the value of the expression.
<br>
<br>
<li>ppyi (standing for pretty print import) which imports the ppyprint
module and creates the prettyprint object.
</ul>
I attach ppy to F12 so I just have to enter the expression and hit
return to get my debugging output. Using 'list-matching-lines' or grep
with 'pyp' give me an easy way to remove the statements.

<h3>pycomplete</h3>

<p>I have included an updated version of pycomplete.
<p>This is a nifty emacs extension which helps one to insert
attributes and functions into a python program.  For instance, one can
type
<br><br>
os.path.is
<br><br>
then ESC-Tab opens a window showing all attributes and function in
os.path which begin with "is".  Also, functions are can be
distinguished from simple attributes because they are followed by
"()".

<p>
Pick one with the mouse and hit <ret> and the completion will take
place. It is required that there be an appropriate include statement,
"os.path" in the example, in order for the completion to work.  If it
is not included one get a message the name is undefined.

<p>I found an early version which was rather limited. Looking around the
net, I found reference to an extension patch.  When I applied the
patch, I agreed that it was better.  So I removed some unnecessary code
from the package and added the facility to distinguish functions and
to end up in the python buffer after the completion. There are two
pieces to the package - pycomplete.el which is loaded by emacs so must
be in the emacs load path and pycomplete.py which should go into an
active site-packages directory or anywhere else in the PYTHONPATH.


<h3>Download</h3>

<p>This collection of extensions may be downloaded from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/page">Summary Page</a>.

<h3>Installaton</h3>

<p>The python mode extensions are installed by placing
"py-mode-ext.el" in the emacs load path specified in the emacs load
path. See below for the code I use in my .emacs to activate the
extensions.

<p>To set up GUD, the emacs debugger
for use with my python mode extensions, set the emacs option
gud-pdbpcommand-name to point to the file "pdb.py".
In my .emacs I have the statement:
<br>
<br>(gud-pdb-command-name "~/pdb.py")
<br>
Of course, I find that pdb.py is now located in 
  /usr/lib/python2.5 and that location could be used in the .emacs
  statement above. The setting can be made via the Options menu.

<p>To use pyp just move pyp.el to the emacs load path and see the
.emacs code below for attaching it to a function key.

<p>Installation of pycomplete is slightly more complicated because it
requires pymacs which needs to have been installed.  For Debian based
systems you can probably use apt-get.  Otherwise, get a tarball and
install it from there.  Look for "pymacs_0.22.orig.tar.gz". If you
can't find it, I can send you a copy. 

<p>I think that pymacs is really great but at present it does not
appear to be supported and the documentation is poor like many Open
Source programs. The main documentation problem I found was a paucity of
examples. For instance, I fussed around for a while before I
discovered that the output of print statements show up in the *Pymacs*
buffer. Pymacs seems to have neither a web site nor a maintainer. Damn
shame! 

<p>Fortunately, pymacs is easier to install than to find. Instructions
are in the package and are pretty standard with nothing to
compile. setup.py does everything without having to compiling
anything.  When I tried testing pycomlete under emacs-22, I found that
merely moving pymacs.el from the distribution directory to the Emacs
load path is sufficient.

<p>Installation of pycomplete consists of merely moving pycomplete.el
to the emacs load path and pycomplete.py to the PYTHONPATH. Again look
at the .emacs code below.

<h4>.Emacs code.</h4>
<p>I have the following code in my .emacs to enable these extensions.

</p><pre>
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook
       	  '(lambda ()
             (load "py-mode-ext")  
             (load "pyp")
             (require 'pycomplete)
             (define-key py-mode-map [f12] 'pyp)
             (define-key py-mode-map "\C-c\C-c" 'py-execute-prog)
             (define-key py-mode-map "\C-c\C-g" 'py-call-pdb)
             (define-key py-mode-map "\C-c\C-w" 'pychecker)))
